## 📝 Usage Examples

### Window Functions Example
```sql
WITH CustomerPurchases AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        category,
        SUM(amount) as total_spent,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY category 
            ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
        ) as category_rank
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY customer_id, category
)
SELECT * FROM CustomerPurchases WHERE category_rank <= 3;
```

### RFM Analysis Example
```sql
WITH CustomerMetrics AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        MAX(order_date) as last_purchase,
        COUNT(order_id) as frequency,
        SUM(amount) as monetary
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
-- Additional RFM calculation logic...
